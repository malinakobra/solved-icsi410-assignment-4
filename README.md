Using Access, write 5 separate SQL queries, named “Query31” through “Query35”. Each query will contain a SQL statement that is your solution for the translation of a “plain English” request.

Each query is worth one point.

<strong>For Query31 through Query35, you <u>must</u> put the join criteria in the ON clause. </strong>

<ol start="31">

 <li>Join Dealership and Employee tables and display all columns. You <strong><u>must</u></strong> use INNER JOIN and ON syntax for this query.</li>

 <li>Join Dealership and Employee tables and display all columns. Include dealerships with no employees. You <strong><u>must</u></strong> use LEFT JOIN and ON syntax for this query.</li>

 <li>Join Dealership and Employee tables and display all columns. Include employees with no dealerships. You <strong><u>must</u></strong> use RIGHT JOIN and ON syntax for this query.</li>

 <li>Join Dealership and Employee tables and display all columns. Include dealerships with no employees and employees with no dealerships. Your query needs to return data that is the result of a FULL OUTER JOIN, but note that there is no such syntax in Access, so you need to come up with an Access SQL work around.</li>

 <li>Join Customer, Relationship, and Dealership tables and display all columns. You <strong><u>must</u></strong> use INNER JOIN and ON syntax for this query.</li>

</ol>

The rules for assignment #1, #2, and #3 are still in effect for this assignment with an important modification:

<em>All joins <strong><u>must</u></strong> be done by matching the appropriate columns in the <strong>ON</strong> clause. In other words, you <strong><u>must</u></strong> use “</em><strong>INNER<em>, </em></strong><strong>LEFT<em>, </em></strong><em>or </em><strong>RIGHT </strong><strong>JOIN</strong><em>” and “</em><strong>ON</strong><em>” syntax to perform the join operation <u>otherwise you will get no credit for your solution</u>.</em>
